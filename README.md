# SWE Final Project
A Company Security Analyzer System:

Most companies donâ€™t realize that they are being actively analyzed by their publicly available security information as well as analysis of the interactions with sinkholes such as Anubis.  This rating is called a BitSight rating and is very similar to a credit score (such as FICO), but specifically with respect to security.  This rating determines insurance rates for cybersecurity insurance as well as is used for vendor management and hygiene.  

While the BitSight rating does a good job indicating overall security hygiene there are a number of factors that are not taken into account.  Cybriant would like to build a system which will analyze these additional factors to determine a more comprehensive analysis of their risk profile.  The risk profile will then be shared with the companies being analyzed to aid in their remediation efforts.

# [Django Framework:](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:

First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.
Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt, docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).
If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.
You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.
See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.
Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket

To get more help:

Join the #django channel on irc.freenode.net. Lots of helpful people hang out there. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC/Tutorial if you're new to IRC.
Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at https://groups.google.com/group/django-users.

## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` which will install all third party dependencies into your node modules folder. After this, run `gulp` which will compile the CSS and move some core dependencies into the vendor directory.

### Gulp Tasks

-   `gulp` the default task that builds everything
-   `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
-   `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
-   `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
-   `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features. This theme was built using node v11.6.0 and the Gulp CLI v2.0.1. If Gulp is not running properly after running `npm install`, you may need to update node and/or the Gulp CLI locally.
