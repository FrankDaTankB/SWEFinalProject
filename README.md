# SWE Final Project
A Company Security Analyzer System 



Most companies donâ€™t realize that they are being actively analyzed by their publicly available security information as well as analysis of the interactions with sinkholes such as Anubis.  This rating is called a BitSight rating and is very similar to a credit score (such as FICO), but specifically with respect to security.  This rating determines insurance rates for cybersecurity insurance as well as is used for vendor management and hygiene.  

While the BitSight rating does a good job indicating overall security hygiene there are a number of factors that are not taken into account.  Cybriant would like to build a system which will analyze these additional factors to determine a more comprehensive analysis of their risk profile.  The risk profile will then be shared with the companies being analyzed to aid in their remediation efforts.
